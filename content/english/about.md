# About Us

Truth in History Ministries is a Christ-centered and Bible-based ministry proclaiming the Lordship of Jesus Christ and His sovereign control of human history as taught in the Holy Scriptures. It is our mission and purpose to proclaim Jesus Christ as our only Savior, Healer, Baptizer, Sanctifier and coming King; to teach the Holy Scriptures in order to edify Christian believers and strengthen local churches. We endeavor to proclaim this message through the means of a website, printed literature, sermon recordings and other available media for the glory and honor of Jesus Christ. 

***We Believe and proclaim Jesus Christ as our Prophet, Priest and King!***

# Statement of Faith and Purpose

**WE BELIEVE** that all "Scripture is given by inspiration of God" (II Timothy 3:16), by which we accept and believe that the Holy Bible not only contains the Word of God, but is the Word of God in its entirety. 

**WE BELIEVE** the Holy Bible to be the immutable, unalterable and inerrant Word of God as originally written and translated from the most ancient manuscripts. Therefore, it reveals the mind, will, purpose and eternal plan of God for all mankind. The revelation of God's Word "came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (II Peter 1:21). "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).

**WE BELIEVE** in the existence of the Almighty, Everliving Creator God of the Holy Bible, commonly known in the English Scriptures, as 'The Lord'. He alone is Spirit, Infinite and Perfect; the Source, Support and End of all things (Genesis 1:1-31; John 1:103). He alone is Sovereign, Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent and is the only True and Living God of the universe (Isaiah 43:11, 44:6).

**WE BELIEVE** in the supernatural act of the incarnation in which God became flesh in the person commonly known in the English Scriptures as Jesus Christ (John 1:14). Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary as the only begotten Son of God, yet as the Word made flesh, He possesses all the divine attributes and qualities of Deity. Therefore, 

**WE BELIEVE** Jesus Christ is God. (Colossians 1:13-20; Hebrews 1:1-3; John 1:1).

**WE BELIEVE** in the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus Christ as being the supreme, efficacious, the only, once and for all, complete atoning sacrifice for our sins. Through and by the atoning death of Jesus Christ He became the mediator of and ratified the New Covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah which is now in existence in the New Testament age of grace, (Hebrews, Chapters 7, 8 & 9) whereby fulfilling the prophecy of Jeremiah 31:31-34.

**WE BELIEVE** that, according to the Scriptures there are ten foundational infallible truths that prove the deity of Jesus Christ even while in human flesh, yet without sin, and He was and is the fulfillment of all Messianic prophecies as contained in the Old Testament (Luke 24:27; Acts 10:43). Those infallible truths concerning the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ are as follows:

1. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:20)
2. His presentation (Luke 2:21-38)
3. His baptismal anointing (Matthew 3:16)
4. His wilderness temptation (Matthew 4:1-11)
5. His sinless life (Hebrews 4:15)
6. His miracles (John 20:30-31; Acts 2:22)
7. His transfiguration (Luke 9:27-36)
8. His substitutionary death (I Peter 3:18)
9. His resurrection (Romans 8:11)
10. His ascension into the heavens (Acts 1:9)

**WE BELIEVE** that He alone became Head over all things to the Church which is His body, and in this exalted position He is everliving to make intercession for the saints (Ephesians 1:20-23; Hebrews 7:25). 

**WE BELIEVE** in the autonomy of all local Christian churches functioning under the Headship of Jesus Christ and the administration of the Holy Spirit.

**WE BELIEVE** that Adam man was originally created in the image and after the likeness of God his Creator (Genesis 1:26). Through willful disobedience of God's law-word, Adam in his nature fell and as a consequence, lost his spiritual life, becoming dead in trespasses and sins and thereby subject to wrath. Through this act of original sin, Adam and all mankind became totally depraved and; therefore, possess a sinful nature by natural birth (Romans 3:23).

**WE BELIEVE** that, as a consequence of the total depravity of the Adamic Race, all mankind (except the man Christ Jesus), is in need of a Savior; yet because of their sinfulness, they are unable to save themselves and are essentially and unchangeably depraved in their nature apart from divine grace. The three major consequences of man's totally depraved nature are sin, sickness and death: both spiritual and physical (Romans 6:23).

**WE BELIEVE** that owing to man's state of universal death through sin, that the only means of salvation is through the exercise of faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning work upon Calvary; and the acceptance of forgiveness of one's sins by the means of divine grace through the act of repentance. 

**WE BELIEVE** that man's salvation through regeneration of the Holy Ghost is only by grace through faith alone and not of works or any degree of human merit (Romans 10:9-10; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 2:8-9). 

**WE BELIEVE** that following a person's repentance of their sins, it is required that they be baptized by immersion in water in the name of Jesus Christ according to Acts 2:38.

**WE BELIEVE** in the divine Spirit of God known in the Holy Scriptures as the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost (both being one and the same as interchangeable terms). 

**WE BELIEVE** the Holy Spirit to be the Comforter whom Jesus promised that the Father would send in His name and is the Paraclete of every Christian believer (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7). 

**WE BELIEVE** in the complete ministry and mission of the Holy Spirit as recorded in the Scriptures including the threefold ministry of reproving "the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment" (John 16:8-11). 

**WE BELIEVE** in the experience of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit as recorded in Acts 2:1-18 as being promised to and available to every Christian believer. 

**WE BELIEVE** that the gifts and administrations of the Holy Spirit are not only relevant but necessary for the fulfillment of the mission and ministry of the church (I Corinthians Chapters 12 & 14).

**WE BELIEVE** that it is the responsibility and mission of the church to faithfully proclaim the whole counsel of God by teaching and preaching the Gospel of grace, the Gospel of the glory of Christ and the Gospel of the kingdom (Matthew 24:14; Acts 9:20; II Timothy 4:2).

**WE BELIEVE** that, according to the Scriptures, God elected and predestined the twelve sons of Jacob/Israel of the family of Abraham as a holy people, a royal priesthood whereby to carry out His plan and purpose in the earth through whom all nations are to be blessed (Genesis 12:1-3; 22:16-18).

**WE BELIEVE** that the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Celtic, Scandinavian and related peoples are the only people that fulfill all the prophetic earmarks that identify them with being the literal physical descendants of the ancient people of Old Testament history known as Israelites (Genesis Chapters 48 & 49; Deuteronomy 7:6-8). Being that every Israelite is born in sin, it is therefore necessary for each one to repent in order to receive the gift of salvation. Salvation is by grace and is not a result of works or genetic lineage.

**WE BELIEVE** in the future bodily return of Jesus Christ to this earth in power and great glory who will sit upon "the throne of His father David and reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke 1:32-33; Acts 1:9-11).
