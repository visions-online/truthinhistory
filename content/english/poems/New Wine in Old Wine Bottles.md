In this day of religious confusion it is imperative that we identify our commitment as to where we stand on many issues that are altering the basic premise of the Christian faith. Several people, when first introduced to the Anglo-Israel truth, have a tendency to confuse this with a fast growing movement within the church at large, known as Messianic Judaism. In order to clarify our position on this issue it is important to know the difference between the two theological positions.

It is not my intention whatsoever to demean or discredit one’s personal faith because of religious difference. Due to the importance of this issue, the confusion of mind in many people and the dire consequences involved, it is necessary to clarify our position. There appears to be two separate camps with overlapping beliefs.

## TRADITIONAL FUNDAMENTALISM

1. It is very obvious to any casual observer, that there is a strong influence within many ‘fundamental’ circles in the evangelical religious world to adapt Apostolic Christianity to fit within the framework of Judaism. This would include practices and beliefs taken from not only the Old Testament, but extra-Biblical traditional Judaism. The religion of modern Judaism is a mixture of Old Testament Biblical Hebraism, Babylonian Talmudism, oral and cultural tradition.

Due to the ignorant infatuation with Judaism on the part of many Christian leaders and the sheep-like innocence of millions of Christian laymen, the foundational truths of Christian belief and practice are now at stake. This infatuation is built on the false premise that the Jewish people of today are the only direct physical descendants of the ancient Hebrews and comprise the totality of all twelve tribes of Israel presently in existence. From this starting point they have concocted a complete unscriptural theological and prophetic body of doctrinal beliefs.

## MESSIANIC JUDAISM

2. On the other hand, certain elements of Messianic Judaism consider the Jewish people as only comprising the Tribe of Judah. Therefore, they have to look elsewhere for the modern descendants of the other eleven sons of Jacob/Israel. In doing so, some have rightfully identified the Anglo-Saxon Germanic Christian nations as comprising the majority of true Israel today. But in their excitement of this new found truth, through ignorance they consider themselves “Jewish.” They seem to have a partial knowledge of the ‘two-house’ concept of Scripture, yet attempt to adapt their Christian belief and practice to become “Jewish” as much as possible.

In both or either of the above mentioned camps the following can be found. They:

1. Consider the modern Israeli Zionist state as being the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.
2. Feel that Christians are obligated to morally and financially support the Jewish people and the Israeli state above any other people or nation.
3. Believe that a literal Jewish Temple will be constructed in Jerusalem
4. Are in favor of the institution of the rabbinical schools for training priests to function in the ordinances of Levitical worship.
5. Make excuses for the tentative plans for re-instituting the ordinance of animal sacrifice in the alleged future Jewish temple.
6. Have adopted the singing of Jewish chants in their Christian worship services.
7. Advocating the wearing of Jewish priestly prayer shawls during times of personal devotions.
8. Blow the shofar (ram’s horn) during Christian worship services.
9. Consider the six-pointed star and other historical and cultural Jewish icons as somehow sacred or at least deserving of special reverence.
10. Feel obligated to observe “Hebrew” festivals including the annual Old Testament Feast Days as requirements in keeping with the commandments of the “Jewish” Torah.
11. Encourage the use of the ‘sacred’ names of God, such as Yahweh and Yahshua instead of Jesus. These and other words and names which allegedly are Hebrew in origin helps to give the user a feeling of being ‘Jewish.’

As a Christian Anglo-Israel believer, living under the terms of the New Covenant (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:7-13), I am thoroughly convinced that we must have a Biblical focus of our faith. That focus is none other than for the born again believer to find Full salvation in Jesus Christ ALONE! Reverting back to the practice of observing the Old Testament law of ordinances is to “turn again to the weak and beggarly elements” that result in bondage (Gal. 4:8-11).

Our salvation is by the sovereign grace of the Lord Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8). A Christian believer’s growth in grace and knowledge is by the Word of God, prayer, fellowship, obedience and by living a life of holiness, II Peter 1:1-11.

The Christian Anglo-Israel doctrinal position on history and prophecy differs from many other Christians today, but that does not mean that our position is unbiblical. Most Christians have not studied the Anglo-Israel truth, therefore are ignorant of its overwhelming evidence and are without understanding. But there is one subject, in which we desire to declare our belief unequivocally and be fully understood, that subject is the doctrine of eternal salvation. We believe that the ONLY means of man’s salvation is through the blood of Jesus Christ which He shed in His substitutionary death on the cross. See Romans 5:6-11; 6:23; I Cor. 1:18; Gal. 6:14; Colossians 1:20-22; I Timothy 2:5-6; Hebrews 9:11-15.

No where under the terms of the New Covenant, does our Lord Jesus or any Apostle encourage Christians to return to the observance of Old Testament ordinances or Jewish rituals. In fact, the apostle Paul clearly denounces such practices as having been done away with by the death of Jesus Christ. Galatians 5:1-12; Colossians 2:4-9; Heb. 6:4-6, 10:26-31.

Truly born again believers should be thoroughly Christian, through and through, and not trying to observe traditional cultural practices of Judaism or the rites of any other religion. This practice among Christians seems to be of fairly recent origin due to the hype in the futuristic approach to prophecy. Never throughout the long history of the Christian Church were Christians in the western world engaged in or encouraged to be engaged in such practice. The only two ordinances established in the Christian Church under the terms of the New Covenant are communion and water baptism.

We strongly believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, Emmanuel, God in flesh, (John 1:14) and therefore we refuse to dilute the Christian Faith with any non-Christian religion including ancient or modern Judaism.

The undue importance and attention being given to the modern Zionist Israeli state and anything Jewish by modern Protestant religious leaders, acts as a spiritual blinder to the understanding of Biblical prophecy. The Jewish based futuristic prophetic market has created financial windfalls for several modern “Bible’ teachers.

It is our sincere prayer that Jesus Christ would be the focal point of all evangelical preaching, because He alone is our propitiation with God. The true ‘spirit of prophecy’ is the testimony of Jesus Christ, (Rev. 19:10) and not a mixture of foreign elements taken from non-Christian religions. A correct understanding of prophecy coupled with Christ centered preaching encourages true worship of our Savior as Prophet, Priest and King. When Christians attempt to mix New Covenant beliefs and practices with Old Testament Levitical ordinances, they are guilty of what our Savior warned us not to do. He said that new wine should not be poured into old bottles (Matt. 9:17).
