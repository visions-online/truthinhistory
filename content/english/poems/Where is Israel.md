Men don't believe in the Bible now, as they really ought to do
They've locked the door on the "chosen race" and won't let "my nation" through
There isn't a print of Israel's foot or a dart from Joseph's bow
To be found in earth or in air today, for "the church" has voted it so.
But who owns "the gates" of the world today?  Who is it rules the waves?
Who dwells alone in the "appointed place," while the enemy hates and raves?
Who stands today in the thick of the fight, oppression and sin to quell?
If it isn't the hosts of the living God, won't somebody rise and tell?

Who sends God's Word around the world, to prepare the path for our Savior's feet?
Who frees the captives and plants the rose, who is reigning from David's seat?
So Israel is voted not to be, of course this is untrue
For who is doing the kind of work, Israel alone can do? 

We're told the church takes Israel's place; but the Bible plainly says
A kingdom of stone that's cut out for His own, shall stand till the end of days
Who owns and carries the flags that wave, to the earth's remotest bounds?
If Israel by a unanimous vote, is nowhere to be found? 

Won't somebody step to the front, forthwith and make his bow and show
Where the chief of the nations is today?  We very much want to know.
For Israel is blindly voted out; and Israel â€˜tis said is gone
But the Anglo Saxons would like to know, who carries God's business on.
