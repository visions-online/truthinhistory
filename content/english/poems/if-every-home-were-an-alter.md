If every home were an altar,
Where holiness vows were paid,
And life's best gifts in sacrament
Of purest love were laid;

If every home were an altar
Where harsh and angry thought
Was cast aside for kindly one,
And true forgiveness sought;

If every home were an altar
Where hearts weighed down with care
Could find sustaining strength and grace
In sweet uplift of prayer;

Then solved would be earth's problem
Banished sin's curse and blight;
For God's own love would radiate
From every altar light.
