The sheep of Israel, lost and lone,
Had gone astray so wide,
Men thought them cast away and thrown
As useless clay aside.
Not so, our God; He knew the way
Wherein He led the sheep;
Across the hills though they might stray,
And o'er the valleys deep.

All lost, for ever lost, men say;
No trace of them is known;
But our Father knows where they are today,
And He the lost will own.

And Jesus came to find them too,
His life for them He gave;
Commanded His disciples go
The lost to find and save.

And so the sheep shall yet come back,
Give all their wanderings o'er'
They yet shall find the homeward track,
And leave the home no more!
