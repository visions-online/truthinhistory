America you’re losing your freedom, Most likely it’s already gone. You have rejected the Lord God Jehovah And made pagan gods your own.

America you’re losing your freedom,
Most likely it’s already gone.
You have rejected the Lord God Jehovah
And made pagan gods your own.

America whom God has exalted,
Whose children in freedom have thrived,
We’ve drank from polluted fountains,
And now more dead than alive.

America, your plains and your mountains
With cattle and fruit and bread,
The cankerworm now is destroying,
For you have rejected your God.

You have called on the witches of Endor,
Took counsel from the prophets of Baal,
You’ve opened the gates of your cities,
Behold now a living hell.

Oh America, Hear the cry of the innocent
Whose blood testifies of your sin.
Oh God, have mercy upon us.
Oh Jesus come to us again.

Oh Dear God, would the tears of repentance
Dampen your altars again.
Your people have lost true conviction,
There’s no real awareness of sin.

False prophets, false shepherds, false teachers
Speak (good times) for silver and gold,
And true prophets of God who would warn them
Are scorned as prophets of old.

Oh God, it’s a sad but true story,
Is there time enough left to be told?
You promised you would gather a remnant
And bring them home safe in the fold.

And now at the eve of destruction
There’s only one place that we can hide:
Run back to the Rock of Ages,
Our Savior, our Lord, and our God.
