Our new 360 page book, Who Hath Believed our Report is now available.  Find out what prominent men of God believed the Anglo-Israel message.  Pastors, evangelists and some of America’s greatest religious leaders of yesteryear preached this great truth throughout North America and Great Britain. To your surprise you will learn that this message was well known and accepted in the early days of the Pentecostal movement.

Find out why historically, it was the western European nations which comprised Christendom (Christ’s Kingdom) and the foundation of America was based on the Bible and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.   No longer be in doubt why the Gospel message was readily accepted in the West in its early expansion after the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2.

Why have the great modern missionary movements of the last three centuries originated among the people of western European descent in fulfilling God’s promise to Abraham to “bless all the families of the earth”?
