This Video presents strong evidence through historical documents that the Apostle Paul did indeed visit ancient Britain. Between his two Roman imprisonments, this Missionary to the ‘Gentiles’, in fulfillment of his call preached the Gospel to the Israelites that were scattered abroad in the far reaches of the Roman Empire. There is evidence of St. Paul’s visit and ministry in southern England and his work in strengthening the Christian Church which had been founded some thirty years before his arrival.
