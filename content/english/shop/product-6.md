This is the story of the only Messianic Divine time measure recorded in Holy Writ—Daniel’s Seventy Weeks. The truth of its interpretation begins with a journey back to the Protestant Reformation. It was during this period of Church history that this great prophecy’s commonly understood fulfillment was hermeneutically attacked and distorted. The confusing results of this theological assault are with us to this day and manifest itself in the teaching that a seven-year tribulation period is yet to come. This doctrine was birthed in Counter-Reformation Europe during the 16th century. What was this doctrinal assault’s ultimate purpose? Who first taught it? Why was this new interpretation of Daniel chapter nine rejected by scholastic Protestant clergy for centuries? Who were its authors trying to protect? What is the true alternative which was believed by all of Christendom for over a millennium? How has this affected our perceptions and understandings of Christ’s Kingdom? This book reveals the truth about Daniel’s 70th week. Its contents shatter the sand-built foundations of today’s popular 21st century Bible prophecy teaching, properly titled Futurism but commonly understood to be Dispensationalism! Author Robert Caringola holds a B.A. in History from the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, and was accepted into Phi Alpha Theta, a history honors fraternity. His ministerial office is that of a teacher in the five-fold ministry (Eph. 4:11). He has prepared for a decade to repair the breach in the interpretation of Daniel’s seventy weeks. If God wills, this is the first of many systematic teachings to emerge on the subject of eschatology.
