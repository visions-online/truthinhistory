One of America's least known spiritual revivals saved the cultural and spiritual heritage of the nation and preserved Biblical Christianity for succeeding generations!! One such time of spiritual refreshing in our history came during one of the darkest hours of our existence as a nation. In fact, the Lord saw fit to providentially send this revival to our people during the time when we were the most divided in terms of politics, education, culture, economics and religious faith. This was during the military conflict that we know as 'The War for Southern Independence' of 1861 - 1865. The results of this revival are still reflected today as the South is known as the “Bible Belt.” Running time 58:30 Price $15.00
