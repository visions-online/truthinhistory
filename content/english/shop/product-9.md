In this book, Robert Caringola gives the reader a glimpse into the vast array of information which the Historicist view offers in Biblical and historical knowledge. He, along with some of the most wise and learned scholars of the historic Protestant Church set forth truths that thousands of God?s saints have taught and even suffered martyrdom for in promoting the Historicist perspective of Biblical prophecy.
