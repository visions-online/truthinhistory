As a forerunner of what God has prepared for His people in the next generation, He always sends a messenger “To make ready a people prepared for the Lord” (Luke 1:17). John Alexander Dowie holds a unique and definite place in the development of apostolic ideals for the Church of the Twentieth Century. God raised up and sent this most unusual servant at the most opportune time, as he came ministering in the power of Elijah, the spirit of John the Baptist, with the heart of a Shepherd, the zeal of an Evangelist and the message of a prophet. Running time: 28:30 Price $15.00
