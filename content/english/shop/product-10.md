The book of Revelation, above every other book in the Bible is unique in its structure and content. It portrays the fulfillment of all previous prophetic utterances and insights. It brings together into one clear focus the revelations and dealings of God with men as contained in both the Old and New Covenants. The overall content of this book plus it?s many Old Testament symbols, emblems and references to historical events proves beyond any doubt that this book is Israelitish in nature. Its main theme is the unveiling of the person and the work of Jesus Christ in bringing about the fulfillment of His divine plan and purpose in His chosen people Israel. With the assistance of a number of graphic charts and timelines, many passages which formerly seemed obscure and hidden are brought to light, making plain the fact that it is the Father?s desire that we come to understand those things which have been so freely given to His faithful servants.
