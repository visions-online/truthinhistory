This book was written with the firm conviction that the words "Revelation of Jesus Christ" means exactly what they acclaim. Christ's great capstone of the Scriptures, The Book of Revelation was designed by our Lord to progressively reveal Himself throughout the unfolding of His great "eternal" Kingdom. A Kingdom which was destined to grow from a "stone" to become a "great mountain" which will triumph over all its enemies and fill the earth. The prophecy of the revelation is dramatically violent, victorious, and encouraging. It forewarns of a glorious struggle between the true Church and the corporate enemies of Christ. It is written in the symbolic language of the prophets and can only be understood and interpreted with consistent application of this language, a sound knowledge of history and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Therefore this dissertation attempts to summarize the massive volumes of historical literature by providing the reader with a historical linear perspective of the Church. In other words, you'll be shown where we are today in the book of Revelation. This work stands as an aggressive rebuke to the modern dispensational and preterist counter schemes which have caused the church to fall from clear prophetic understanding for generations. "Peace if possible, but the truth at all costs." Freeing language from the Reformation.
