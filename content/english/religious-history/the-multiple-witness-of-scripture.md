“Sit . . . Until . . .” The Multiple Witness of Scripture
By Robert Caringola

>1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

>2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

>3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power... 

Psalm 110

What I am going to share with you in this article, I have shared with many Christians who thought they understood bible prophecy. From so called Doctors of Theology to the simply inquisitive, they all recoiled in what the prophets called “astonishment”! Their Christ-returning-any-day concepts were shattered.

Now, before I proceed:

>9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

>10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;

>11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. Acts 1

This proclamation of the angels, I do believe! As a matter of fact, in the new Jerusalem of Revelation chapter 21, it states: “…God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” Vs.3b. The God who will walk amongst us, on this earth, is Jesus.

This glorious 110th Psalm makes is perfectly clear that Christ will symbolically “sit” on the right hand (the power of God) in the heavenly “until” his enemies are made His footstool, in other words, conquered. And take notice; it does not say that all His enemies will be saved. Many will have to be crushed by Zion, the Covenant Nations.

Note: If I just lost you, I encourage you to get to the Truth In History website and get informed.

Now before we look at several affirmations of this prophecy in the New Testament, let me ask you the same question I ask the brethren who are contemplating, for the first time, this theology-shaking theme. How can futurist Bible prophecy teachers (current 21st century speculators) try to tell us that we could have a rapture any day, then the Antichrist will appear for the seven year tribulation period? Wait a minute! Didn’t we just read that Christ will sit until his enemies are made His foot stool? So you’re trying to tell me that Christ will leave the throne, descend to the earth and rapture His saints, then the horrific “enemy” antichrist will arise?

Hey, just a fun and holy fact of scripture: Remember, Christ is the head of His body, the church. We have the feet. You mean that these hostile enemies will be our foot stool?

>3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 

Psalm 47

>20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. Romans 16

Hang in there. I’m just getting warmed up!

Our first witness as to the importance of David’s prophecy will be our Lord Jesus Christ. He was addressing the question of David’s son.

>35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?

>36 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

>37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly. Mark 12

Christ’s vindication of this prophecy, relating to His future glory, is probably why the apostles were so adamant when quoting it on multiple occasions. The common people heard the Lord gladly. So be it again that soon the common people will hear the truth of this and gladly perceive its relevance in understanding the growth principle of the kingdom of God!

Now we turn to the apostles. Guess what is proclaimed by Peter at the opening volley of the New Testament church on the day of Pentecost?

>33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.

>34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

>35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

>36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Acts 2

The first New Testament apostolic sermon included this admonition. Peter wanted to make sure that the House of Israel knew that David spoke of Christ. And that this Christ would sit enthroned in power at the right hand of God – until! I assert that few in the House of Israel today know the truth of this passage and its inferences. How sad.

Here now we turn to Paul. He expounds on Psalm 110:1 and provides further insight and revelation (to put it mildly). Be assured, few in the ministry comprehend what is revealed here. Again, how sad.

>24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

>25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

>26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

>27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.

>28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. I Corinthians 15

When death is destroyed, and not “until,” our God will come and walk amongst men again.

Our next witness will be the writer of Hebrews.

>13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Hebrews 1

The writer proceeds to clarify the truth of the matter:

>8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. Hebrews 2

>12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;

>13 From henceforth expecting [ waiting ] till his enemies be made his footstool. 

Hebrews 10

I ask, could it be any plainer?

I want the reader to understand that I have purposely presented this article in what might appear to be a choppy manner. I am not writing for the sake of prose and eloquence. I simply want to present the evidence of scripture. So let us now conclude with some sanctified common sense from the Book of Revelation.

Relative to the plan, order and continuum of this magnificent prophecy, the author of the *“Horae Apocalypticae,”* E.B Elliott, stated, 

>“Accordingly, the three septenaries of Seals, Trumpets and Vials will be interpreted by me as a connected and consecutive series; - the seventh Seal unfolding itself in the seven Trumpet visions, the seventh Trumpet in the seven Vials: and this with no intermission or interruption.” 

This has come to pass and those of us who know the truth of the great protestant historical school of correct interpretation (Historicism) understand that we are currently somewhere transitioning from the sixth Vial to the seventh. It is in this seventh Vial that all Christ’s enemies are finally subjugated. Babylon falls! Gog and Magog are destroyed! The devil is cast into the lake of fire – forever and ever! And God will wipe away all tears, for the former things have passed away. After these things, the heavens will no longer retain our Lord. He will be walking amongst us – forever!
