THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR brings with it the thought of the new things which God gives to those who obey and serve Him.

## JUDAH AND ISRAEL ARE GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE

Their dispersion among the other nations of the world resulted in the loss of their identity.

But Jehovah knows them, and the New Covenant, so clearly explained in Hebrews, Chapters 8, 9, and 10, shows how He distinguishes the Spiritual from the Natural Seed.

>"I will put My laws on their heart, and upon their mind also will I write them; and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."

---Hebrews 10:16, 17
 
As we look into the faces and hear the testimonies of those who have been blessed and healed spiritually, psychically, and physically, we see that their hearts have been touched, that their habits and manner of living have been changed.  They now hate the destructive things they once loved.

Without a doubt they have come into their inheritance under this New Covenant.  We ask how they came into possession.  The reply is invariably LEAVES OF HEALING.

"We could not find the straight gate and narrow way.  We were shown it by God's Message through these printed pages."
 
##THIS NEW COVENANT IS THE MESSAGE BORNE BY "LEAVES OF HEALING."

One of the difficulties through all the ages since it went into effect is to make it known to the inhabitants of the earth and overcome the false teachings by which so many millions are deceived.

If each Christian in Zion today can present these truths to just one person each year and convince and convert him, and, when that one is converted, if he will turn and help in the same way, the 1,500,000,000 people on the earth can be taught the Gospel in twenty years.
