David Wilkerson (1931-2011) was born into the home of Pentecostal parents. He attended Central Bible Institute from 1951-1952. He started his ministry by pastoring a small church in Philipsburg, PA. During a prayer vigil in 1958 his attention was drawn to an article in Life magazine depicting the story of the murder trial of seven young men who had killed a crippled boy in New York City. Through this and other related events with street gang members, he founded Teen Challenge. Beginning in New York as a ministry to gang members, the outreach of Teen Challenge eventually resulted in the Christian conversion of scores of teenagers and the establishment of development centers and Bible College for young converts. In 1974 the Lord gave him a vision describing the immoral conditions of the American culture and future events of judgment as a consequence of our nation’s rebellion against God. He was the author of many books including the popular, The Cross and The Switchblade (1963) and Set The Trumpet To Thy Mouth (1985). In 1972 David Wilkerson established World Challenge as a wider expansion of his evangelistic ministry and in 1987 he with others founded Times Square Church in New York City
