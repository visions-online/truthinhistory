## THREE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON THE ISRAEL QUESTION

Throughout the history of the church, the Lord has been faithful in visiting His people with times of spiritual refreshing and demonstrations of His saving and healing power. During the early 20th century, Great Britain experienced a ‘Book of Acts’ type of revival through the ministry of Evangelists George and Stephen Jeffreys.

The sixth of eight sons, George Jeffreys was born in Wales in 1889. He was raised in the Welsh Independent (Congregational) Church. He and his older brother Stephen (1876-1943) were converted during the Welsh revival on November 20, 1904. George had very ill health and suffered from a speech impediment and facial paralysis. The same day in April 1911 in which he was baptized in water, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit and miraculously healed. Soon afterward he entered the evangelistic ministry and in 1915 formed the Elim Pentecostal Alliance.

In 1924 both George and Stephen spent five months holding evangelistic meetings in the United States and Canada.

George continued to hold revival crusades for many years not only in Great Britain, but in Sweden, Switzerland and other European cities. In each meeting, there were huge crowds, scores of healings and thousands converted.

In July 1914, while Stephen Jeffreys was pastor of the Island Place Mission, a vision occurred while he was preaching. On the wall of the church appeared the face of a lamb and then changed to the face of the "Man of Sorrows," which was witnessed up to six hours by hundreds of people. Until 1935 Stephen traveled and preached in the United States, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa which resulted in thousands of converts.

In his book "With Signs Following," Stanley H. Frodsham reported that "from Wales God raised up two brothers who have been more or less leaders in the Pentecostal work in the British Isles."  He continued by saying;

>"The campaigns held by George Jeffreys have packed some of the largest halls in the British Isles, including the historic hall of St. Andrews, Glasgow, with its seating capacity of 4,500; the Guild Hall of Plymouth, which accommodates nearly 4,000; the Dome of Brighton, formerly the property of King George IV, with seating capacity of 300; and the Royal Albert Hall of London which accommodates 10,000. Over 1200 were swept into the Kingdom in the campaign held in Brighton, and 300 gave testimony to the Lord’s healing power." One who attended this meeting writes, "Hundreds of people have testified in the meeting to having been healed. People who only a few weeks ago were bedridden, or wheeled about in chairs, are today walking and praising God for His kindness in healing them. Lame ones, who moved only by the aid of crutches, are able to dispense with these. Deaf ones have been made to hear, blind ones to see, fourteen testified to having been cured of cancer, tuberculosis or tumor."

Rev. Albert W. Edsor, in his book, "George Jeffreys-Man of God" states:

>Principal George Jeffreys, founder of the Elim Movement in 1915 and later of the Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship, was undoubtedly one of this century’s greatest evangelists and Bible teachers. As one has written:

"...Beginning in obscurity, he was not only unsponsored by the religious denominations of his day but opposed by them. Yet he pioneered with the utmost courage the full New Testament message until the largest auditoriums of this and other lands were crowded to capacity with men and women who were being moved Godward by his powerful ministry."

Both George and Stephen Jeffreys were strong believers in the Christian Anglo-Israel message of the Bible. The following is an article written by George Jeffreys which both clarifies and confirms his belief in this great Biblical truth of the Christian Anglo-Israel message.

## THE ISRAEL QUESTION
### By GEORGE JEFFREYS

There are different Schools of Thought on the Israel question, just as there are on other questions and there are sincere teachers in all. How can it be otherwise if all are to contend earnestly for the whole Counsel of God! The purpose of differences of opinion in the churches is emphasized by Weymouth’s translation of I Corinthians 11:19;

"For there must of necessity be difference of opinion among you, in order that it may be plainly seen who are the men of sterling worth among you."

We should, therefore, encourage the examination of various schools of thought, for by this means the mind is enriched, truth is revealed and the character tested.

Ever since my early pioneering days of the Pentecostal truth, with signs following the preaching of the Scriptures, opposers have known that the message could be hindered by cutting out discussion about it, whereas open discussion helped to spread it. We have not been ignorant of these devices and, following the example of the Apostle Paul, have gone on "...disputing and persuading the things concerning the Kingdom of God" (Acts 19:8).

The devices to hinder the Israel truth are exactly the same as those used to hinder the Pentecostal truth. The undercurrent of misrepresentation of the Israel truth confuses the mind and hides the truth, whereas free discussion opens up the understanding and spreads truth.

# THE THREE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT

## The Jewish School

According to this School, Jews only are the lineal descendants of God’s chosen people Israel and the prophecies and promises concerning Israel have either been, or yet will be fulfilled in the Jewish people.

I cannot accept the view of the Jewish school, because the Judah tribe is only a very small part of Israel. There are twelve heads of Israel tribes named in Genesis 49 and with Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, of chapter 48, to whom the birthright came from Jacob/Israel through Joseph, there are thirteen in all.

Jacob/Israel’s prophetic blessings to the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh have not been fulfilled in the Judah tribe, neither can be, for the simple reason they were not promised to the descendants of Judah;

"...he (Manasseh) also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother (Ephraim) shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a fullness of nations" (Genesis 48:19 R.V. marg).

The descendants of the whole house of Israel are on earth today and will be revealed in the last days as one great nation, with Jehovah in the midst of them. That day, thank God, is very near!

"And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all" (Ezekiel 37:22).

"And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else; and My people shall never be ashamed" (Joel 2:27).

## The Church School

According to the Church School, the Church has taken the place of the Israel Nation and God’s promises to Israel have to be spiritualized.

I cannot accept the view of the Church School because God has not substituted the Church of Christ for the Nation of Israel. God’s promises to the earthly Nation have never been – and never can be – fulfilled in the spiritual Body of Christ.

Israel, the elect company of servant nations, with the members of the Church of Christ in her midst, has been and is being made a blessing to the whole world, as foretold in the prophetic Scriptures. Missionaries have been sent forth in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ to the ends of the earth; the Scriptures are being distributed throughout the world; heavy burdens of other nations are being borne; the oppressed are being set free and bread is being dealt to the hungry. The Scriptural marks of Israel and its spiritual remnant can be seen by all who have eyes to see.

"I say then, Hath God cast away His people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away His people which He foreknew ...For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?" (Romans 11:1,2 & 15)
 
## Israel Is An Election Of Race

"But thou, Israel, art My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend. Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art My servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away" (Isaiah 41:8-9).

## The Church Is An Election of Grace

"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering...And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him" (Colossians 3:12 & 17).
 
## The Israel School

According to the Israel School, a large part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Americans and other Celto-Anglo-Saxon peoples are the lineal descendants of Israel. But like the lineal descendants of Gentiles, each Israelite must be born again to enter the Church of Christ.

I accepted the view of the Israel School in the early days of my Elim ministry. That eminent barrister-at-law, Mr. John Leech, MA.,LL.B., K.C., introduced me to this School nearly 40 years ago (about 1920); and I have remained in it ever since.

The indisputable fact that, although some Jews are Israelites, all Israelites are not Jews, gave me the right premises that led to right conclusions. The truth is demonstrated in my own experience; all Welshmen are British, but all British are not Welshmen.

Should a person be so foolish as to teach that the Welsh people constitute the whole of the British Commonwealth of Nations, he would rightly be considered a fanatic of the first order. Yet some can teach that the Jewish people are the whole of the Israel Company of Nations and regard themselves as being wise!

Furthermore, those who teach that Israel and the Church are the same should be consistent and teach that the natural birth into the Israel Nation is the same as the spiritual birth into the Church of Christ.

I t is evident that those who do not distinguish between the Jews, Israelites and the members of Christ’s body have not paid much heed to Paul’s message to Timothy:

"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth" (II Timothy 2:15).

Some Jewish people form the smaller number of the lineal descendants of the whole house of Israel. The larger number (partially blind to their destiny in Christ) are in the British Commonwealth of Nations, in America and in the Celto-Anglo-Saxon Nations.

"...blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in" (Romans 11:25).

The promises made to Israel could not be applied to the Body of Christ, the Church. They were to have their fulfillment in families, nations, kings and land.

"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and He called his name Israel. And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins: And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land" (Genesis 35:9-12).

After Abraham had offered up Isaac God gave him an unconditional promise concerning his seed. This has never been fulfilled in any one tribe, but it has been fulfilled in the peoples mentioned in The Israel School.

"And the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast heard my voice" (Genesis 22:15-18).

The Israel Nation was destined to be in existence as long as the sun, moon and stars are in existence. This was a promise concerning the whole House of Israel and not just one tribe.
"Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is His name: if these ordinances depart from before Me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me forever" (Jeremiah 31:35-36).

Israelites and Gentiles must be born again before they can become members of the Body of Christ, the Church.
"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:6-7).
