The INCARNATION of the eternal Son, involving the virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ was a plan conceived in the mind of the Infinite before the dawn of creation.

Think of Christ correctly. Take Him out of the man class. Put Him in the God class. He never had a beginning. He is an eternal being. Associate yourself with Him and you will become a recipient of the same eternal life that we saw manifested in Him during the days of His flesh. He was born into this life for a purpose.

Long before the foundations of our earth were laid and before the heavens were stretched forth like a scroll...before the valleys were scooped out or the mountains piled high...before a carpet of grass was unrolled for humans to walk upon, or the earth was laced with babbling brooks and flowing streams...before a furnace was placed in the sun or the wheels of our solar system started turning!

Back there, in the undated past called eternity, before the sons of God shouted for joy it was foreordained that the WORD should become flesh and dwell among men on this planet.

What we saw at Bethlehem was the consummation of that plan, the materialization of the original conception in the mind of the Infinite.

Jesus Christ did not come to reform but to transform. Not to repair but to replace. Not to save us from wrong-doing but to save us from wrong-being.

He came to bring life. The natural man is dead in trespasses and sin. He said: "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."

The personality of Jesus Christ is the hub, the great central fact of all Scripture. Both the Old and New Testaments are woven around His majestic personality. In order to understand Him and to cooperate with Him for the accomplishment of divine purposes in our lives, we must take Him out of the man class and put Him in the God class.

Who had glory with God in the eons of eternity before the worlds were framed? Jesus Christ .

Who is mentioned more than three hundred times in the Old Testament alone? Jesus Christ.

Who is referred to in every book of the Bible? Jesus Christ.

Who was supernaturally born? Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary? Jesus Christ.

Who lived a sinless life? Who lived in sin and yet without sin? Jesus Christ.

Who tasted death for every man and entered into an atonement great enough to include the last sinner who walks the dirt roads of earth? Jesus Christ.

Who conquered hades? Who came out of the new tomb of Joseph of Arimathea in triumphant resurrection? Who tasted death for every man? Who broke the power of death over redeemed souls? Jesus Christ.

On top of the mountain whose body became all aglow with the glory of God? Who transcended gravity and was lifted up and out of sight in the ascension? Who ascended into heaven?  Jesus Christ.

Then two witnesses appear dressed in white raiment. They inquire, "Men of Galilee why these tears? Do you not know that this same Jesus will come again as He has departed now?" Who is coming again, King of Kings and Lord of Lords? Jesus Christ.

He came from the bosom of the Father to the bosom of a Virgin. He left the ivory palaces, came down to this earth and put on humanity that we might put on divinity.

He became the Son of Man that we might become the sons of God. He came from heaven where rivers never freeze, winds never blow, frosts never chill, flowers never fade, no one is ever sick and no one ever dies. He stooped low to our level, that we might be given a foretaste of heaven and see God in a human body. Jesus lived the human life of God.

As the magnifying glass beings out the hidden beauties of the rose, so also He displays before us the hidden beauties of deity.

He was born in a supernatural way. He lived in poverty. He grew up in obscurity. He had no wealth. He attended no college. Yet the profoundest wisdom of men has never equaled His discourses. The record says: "Never man spake like this man."

His relatives were inconspicuous folk living in a rural community. In infancy He frightened a king. In boyhood, He puzzled doctors of the law. At the age of twelve He possessed greater wisdom than theologians. He was taught of God..

In manhood He ruled the elements. He defied the law of gravitation by walking on water. Winds obeyed His voice. He spoke peace to a raging sea. He healed multitudes without medicine and made no charge for His services. He never wrote a book. Yet many libraries would be required to accommodate the books that have been written about Him.

He never wrote a song. Yet He has furnished the theme of more songs than all the song writers combined. He never founded a college, and yet all the schools in the world put together cannot boast the number of students who studied under Him. He healed broken hearts. He blessed little children. He healed the sick. He cleansed the leper. He raised the dead. He went about doing good. He was the Man of Mercy.

He associated with sinners. He ate with publicans. In fact, one had to be a sinner to attract His attention. He said: "The Son of man is come to seek, and to save, that which was lost. He has power to transform human lives. He specializes in making bad people good. That is the greatest of all miracles, transforming sinners into saints.

He never mobilized an army, or drafted a soldier, or fired a gun. Yet no military leader has ever enlisted as many volunteers as those who take orders from Him.

You do not need to be an astronomer to understand that He is the Day Star of Eternal Hope. You do not need to be a geologist to understand that He is the Rock of Ages. You do not need to be a zoologist to understand that He is the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world. You do not need to be a botanist to understand that He is the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley. You do not need to be a musician to understand that He is the great Harmonizer of all discords. You do not need to be a doctor to understand that He is the Healer of human ills.

Great men have come and gone. He lives on. Herod could not kill Him. People at a religious service could not stone Him. Satan could not tempt Him. Death could not destroy Him. The grave could not contain Him. Demons obeyed Him.

He fed a hungry multitude with the lunch of a small boy. He broke up funerals. He gave life back to those who were dead. He said: "I am the resurrection and the life."

He laid aside His Royal robe for the gown of a peasant. He was rich but for our sakes became poor. Yet wise men brought Him costly gifts at the time of His birth.

He slept in the manger of a stranger. He sailed on a lake in a borrowed boat. He road into Jerusalem on a borrowed beast. He was buried in a borrowed tomb.

He conquered death. He rose on the third day as He had previously announced. He ascended into heaven. He sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

He will come again. He will judge the nations in righteousness. Every knee shall bow to Him. Every tongue shall confess Him as Lord. His friends will gladly make this confession. His enemies will make the same confession while trying to hide from His face.

He is the perfect One. He is the Chief among ten thousands. He alone can satisfy the soul and give everlasting life to those who will accept. He is altogether lovely.

Jesus attended three funerals in the days of His flesh and in each instance destroyed the last enemy which is death. I repeat, He attended three funerals and He broke up all of them. He specializes in breaking up funerals!

A boy had died. His mother was weeping. Jesus touched the casket and the young man rose from the dead. The daughter of Jairus had died of a fever. Jesus put the doubters out of the room. He took the maidâ€™s hand and said, "Arise." Life was restored. His friend Lazarus had died. Jesus commanded the stone to be rolled away. He said: "Lazarus come forth." Life was restored.

Not long ago I made a trip from Washington, D.C., down the Potomac to Mount Vernon. I visited the tomb of George Washington and that is a sacred spot.

The British have their Westminster Abbey where they bury their noble dead. A great building in India marks the place where the mortal remains of Buddha were laid to rest. But as Christians we rejoice, not in some beautifully decorated tomb under oriental skies. We rejoice in an empty tomb.

HE IS THE CHRIST TRIUMPHANT!
