## Spiritual Revival is a Promised Blessing to the Descendants of Our Father Jacob

Coincidence alone cannot explain why spiritual outpourings of God's grace has been a part of the historical culture of the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic and related people for hundreds of years.

>"As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; my spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and forever."

Isaiah 59:21

There have been hundreds of written accounts of the historical outpourings of the Holy Spirit that have taken place among God's people in the history of the Christian Church.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of  authors have failed to explain the common reason for this reoccurring phenomenon taking place primarily among the people of the Caucasian Western European family of nations.

That common reason, running like a scarlet thread throughout every spiritual revival of Western European history, can be found in the immutable words of the Lord Himself through the mouth of His prophet Isaiah; "Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:  Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, (the upright one) whom I have chosen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground:  I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses." (Isaiah 44:1-4)

Revival is a sovereign move of Almighty God among His chosen people in remaining faithful to the promises of His Word!
 
This is not to say that spiritual revivals have not occurred among people of non-Caucasian racial descent.  Yet it is obvious to see that the vast majority of Christian expansion movements and historical revivals have begun and matured among the Caucasian people and from there the message has been taken by evangelists and missionaries to the people of other racial backgrounds.  This would be in keeping with Israel's calling as a servant people unto God and a witness through whom all the families of the earth would be blessed in the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Isa. 42:19; 43:10; 44:1, 21; Gen. 12:1-3).

The following is a partial  list of the many historical events and sovereign acts of God in manifesting His Word and Spirit among His Christian Israel people that have shaped the national life and culture of Western Civilization.

1. Joseph of Arimathea, the uncle of our Lord with other disciples between the years A.D. 36-38 brought the message of the Gospel of Christ to Britain.  Sir Henry Spelman, the eminent scholar, writes in his Concilia; "We have abundant evidence that this Britain of ours received the Faith, and that from the disciples of Christ Himself, soon after the Crucifixion".  Eusebius wrote, "The Apostles passed beyond the ocean to the Isles called the Brittanic Isles'.   The historian Bishop Ussher stated that "the British National Church was founded A.D. 36, 160 years before heathen Rome confessed Christianity". It is also amazing that the Apostle Paul himself preached the Gospel of Christ in Britain and was later made the patron saint of London after which St. Paul's Cathedral was named, with a statue of the Apostle being placed upon the Cathedral grounds.  The historian Capellus wrote, "I know scarcely of one author from the time of the Fathers downward who does not maintain that St. Paul after his liberation, preached in every country of the West, in Europe, Britain included". (quotes taken from "The Drama of the Lost Disciples" by George F. Jowett)

2. The expansion of the gospel continued until it reached throughout all the British Isles and it became known as the Celtic Church, which preceded the arrival of the Roman Catholic missionary Augustine in 596 A.D. Soon after the establishment of Papal power in Britain many Celtic saints suffered martyrdom for their Apostolic Christian Faith.  Among some of the more well known saints who carried the Gospel through the British Isles were St. David of Wales and Columkille who preached to the Picts of Northern Ireland and who died while translating the Old Testament Scriptures.  He is commonly known as St. Colomba and is affectionately referred to as "The Dove of the Celtic Church".  The most popular preacher of the Celtic Church was Patricius also known as St. Patrick (389-461 A.D.).  Once a prisoner in Ireland, he returned home to Scotland where he had a vision and heard voices from the Irish coast crying "we beseech thee, child of God, come and walk again among us".  In answering the divine call he returned to Ireland where he preached to thousands of people in open fields.  He planted scores of churches and baptized over 100,000 converts.

3. The great Protestant Reformation of the 14th through the 17th centuries was a sovereign move of God which affected every country in Western Europe and set the people free from the spiritual bondage of the Papal Church in Rome.  It restored the authority of the Scriptures among the people and basic Bible doctrines such as salvation by grace and not by works.  The fundamental truths of Protestantism paved the way for the founding of America and the great westward expansion of civilization. Noble men such as John Wycliffe of England, Martin Luther of Germany, John Calvin of France, John Knox of Scotland, John Huss of Bohemia were but a few of the many leaders in this great spiritual reformation that opened the door for subsequent moves of God.

4. The Wesleyan revival throughout Great Britain in the mid and late seventeen hundreds under the leadership of John and Charles Wesley saved England from experiencing a 'French Revolution'.  Tens of thousands of people were converted to Christ which eventually led to the founding of the Methodist Church.  Through the powerful moving of the Holy Spirit in the early days of Methodism in America thousands were converted which helped shape the Christian culture of the South.

5. The great Welsh revival around 1800 was a divine demonstration of the life changing power of the Gospel and a revitalizing force for the churches of Wales.  Thousands of people were converted to Christ under the dynamic preaching of the one-eyed Baptist preacher Christmas Evans. So powerful was this revival that it impacted the country for several years and Christmas Evans was referred to as "the mightiest preacher of the age" and the "renowned apostle of Wales".

6. Another wave of the glory of God swept across Wales in 1904-05 which was unequaled in it's impact upon all of Welch society. Such spiritual conviction for sin gripped the land that saloons and dance halls closed down while churches were crowded with over 100,000 converts added to the body of Christ.  Evan Roberts, that mighty, yet humble servant of Christ was used of God to preach the Word not only in Wales but to give reports of revival throughout Britain.

7. The Hebrides Islands near Scotland around 1950 experienced a tremendous spiritual awakening with a genuine outpouring of the Holy Spirit under the leadership of Duncan Campbell, a Presbyterian minister.

8. God's chosen people in America have experienced such spiritual revivals as the first Great Awakening in New England in 1735-55; then again in the western frontier of Kentucky in 1801, and subsequent revivals such as the Fulton Street revival of 1857, the revival in the Confederate Army of 1861-65 and the Holiness revivals of the 1880's and following.

These and many more divine experiences are witnesses to the faithfulness of our God in keeping His covenants with His chosen people Israel.

It is past time we recognize that both Biblical and historical facts prove that the Anglo-Saxon Germanic and related people are the literal physical descendants of the ancient people of the Bible known as Israelites.  Let's reclaim our racial and spiritual heritage from the people identified by Jesus Christ as the "synagogue of Satan" (Rev. 2:9; 3:9).
