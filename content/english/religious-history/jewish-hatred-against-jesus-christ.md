Was there an organized Jewish conspiracy against the life and ministry of our Savior - the Lord Jesus Christ? Let the Scriptures speak for themselves!

>". . . of the Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sin alway: For the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."

I Thessalonians 2:14-16

In the earthly life and ministry of our Lord, He encountered much opposition as He traveled throughout the ancient land of Palestine in doing the work that His Father sent Him to do. During the first century the land of Palestine where Jesus lived and ministered was divided into three Roman provinces. They were Galilee to the north where Jesus lived as a child and began His ministry; Samaria located in central Palestine where He ministered to the woman at the well in John chapter 4; and Judea to the south where He encountered most of His opposition from the leadership of the Jewish nation and was eventually illegally tried, falsely convicted and crucified as a result of the scheming efforts of the Jews and their manipulation of the Roman civil authorities.

In the Gospel of John the Apostle records the masterful discourse of Jesus that He gave concerning His equality with God and His manifestation as being the living bread sent down from heaven (chapters 5-6). After giving this discourse and seeing the open anger of the Jews in response to His message, He left Judea where Jewish Phariseeism was in total control, and returned to Galilee which offered Him more personal safety. John records:

>"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: For He would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill Him."

(7:1, 11:53-54)

The Jewish leadership, which included Scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, Chief Priests and the Sanhedrin heckled and taunted the Lord Jesus as He conducted His teaching and healing ministry among the people. Their purpose was to catch Him in heresy and blasphemy and eventually use it as evidence against Him at His trial (Luke 20:19-26).

>"... of the Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sin alway: For the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."

## The Talmud

The Talmud is a vast literary work written by Jewish Rabbis that contains civil and religious law. It is not a part of the inspired sacred Scripture. The Palestinian Talmud was written in the 3rd century AD, while the Babylonian Talmud was written around 500 AD. It contains discussions concerning every aspect of Jewish life and thought. The Talmud was written by Jewish Rabbis who were men of 'perverse minds and destitute of the truth'.

## Concerning the names of Jesus, the Talmud refers to Him as:

- Immach Schemo Vezikro which means, "May His name and memory be blotted out."
- Otho Isch = "That man"
- Peloni = "A certain one"
- Naggar Bar Naggar = "The carpenter son of a carpenter"
- Ben Charsch etaim = "The son of a wood worker"
- Talui = "The one who was hanged"

## Concerning Christ Himself, the Talmud accuses Him of being:

- Illegitimate
- Possessed by the soul of Esau and being Esau himself.
- A fool and insane
- A conjurer and a magician
- An idolater
- A seducer
- Crucified For His crimes
- Buried in Hell

"Mr. Freedman publishes the Talmud's description of the birth and death of Christ as follows: 'Jesus is referred to as the son of Pandira, a soldier. Illegitimate and conceived during menstruation. Hanged on the eve of Passover, seduced, corrupted and destroyed Israel. Died like a beast and buried in animal's dirt heap.' Taken from Defender's Magazine October 1957, which quoted Freedman's "Facts are Facts".
