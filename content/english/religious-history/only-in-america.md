## The 10 Lost Tribes

Isaiah, the prophet, wrote that the remnant of Yawheh's people would be found in the "isles of the sea."  Isn't it reasonable this remnant may be the people of the British Isles?

Grant me the possibility and I shall proceed to unravel the great archaeological riddle of the ages, what happened to the ten lost tribes?

The men of Dan escaped slaughter when Shalmanaser subjugated the ten tribes.

As they made their way across Europe, they left indelible evidence of their journey.

They called the places they stopped after the name of their tribe: thus Danube, Dnieper, Denmark, etc., all of which lay along their route of march.

The men of Dan eventually settled in Ireland and were known as Tuatha de Daanana.

None of this is imaginary research.  One has only to dip into the work of the eminent Rabbi S. Raisin to see how well documented and probably this hypothesis is.

Along with the Danites, the other coastal tribes, the Asher, Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, escaped Shalmanaser's fury.  Obviously, the Simeonites became the Simoni [or Cimerii] of Wales.

The Danites called their new home arzaret, which means "another Land of Israel" and gradually they also came to call themselves Gauls which is a metamorphosis of the word "Golim" meaning exiles.

Some of them called themselves Saccae which derives from Succotites and means "dwellers in booths."
 Theses were the fellows who emigrated to the next island and came to call themselves Scotsmen for all "Scotch" means, as any student of Anglo-Saxon know, is "Irisher."

Others from Ireland emigrated to Wales and the folk ethos remained strongest here.

David remained their favorite name and became their patron saint, although they forgot their Hebrew for as Isaiah said,

"For with stammering lips and with a strange tongue shall it be spoken to the people."

Returning once again to the Old Testament for more verification, we see that when Zedekiah, the last ruler of Judea was carried off into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, his daughter, Tea Tophi found refuge under the guardianship of Jeremiah.

Jeremiah also saved her royal escutcheon, the harp, and the Wonderful Stone, the fountain stone of the temple of Mount Zion.  When Tea Tephi married Heremon, the ruler of the Danites, the Lion of Judah was united with the Unicorn of Joseph a characteristic of all English heraldry.

Last but not least, consider that the word "Britain" may well be a corruption of the Hebrew "Brith-am" meaning the "people of the Covenant."

What do I mean by all this?  Simple.

The Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, and the Irish Catholics are really my cousins -- all right, so it's a few times removed.

All of us knew it all along.
