"I, Cyril Leach, a Jew of pure extraction, write testifying to the great light given me by British-Israel Truth, and how through this wonderful key to the Bible, I came to the belief that Jesus Christ is of a truth the Son of God and the Redeemer of Israel . . . I come from a line of Rabbis on both my father’s and my mother’s side known far and wide in Palestine for their piety, charity and wide learning. Indeed to this day one of my great grandfathers has a synagogue dedicated to his name in the Holy City . . . it was not until I reached the age of sixteen that I began to reflect at all seriously or deeply about religion. One of the first things that sorely perplexed me was the position of my own people in the world . . . I began to wonder if the words ‘God’s chosen people’ were not mere platitudes . . . why had our people no King when God had sworn to David "Thy throne shall be established for ever"? God said to Abraham "Behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shall be the father of many nations." These and other points let me to doubt whether the Bible was after all God’s Word . . . I was assured that the Saxon people were a Gentile people, inferior as regards race to the Jews, and I remember asking my father "If the Jews are God’s chosen people, why is such a wonderful Empire (Britain) . . . doing the very work the Jews should be doing" . . . One day a book was lent me, setting out what appeared to me at the time a preposterous idea, that the Saxon race is the continuation of the Northern Kingdom of Israel carried into captivity in 721 B.C. a long time before the Southern Kingdom of Judea was shattered by Babylon. I laughed at the notion that an uncircumcised people who believed in an imposter called Christ who set Himself up as the Son of God, could be the Seed of Abraham. For the first time in my life I began a most careful search of the Word of God - the acid test of all religious movements to see if there was any truth in this astounding assertion. To my intense surprise I found that prophecy after prophecy had materialized and was in the process of materializing in the Saxon people. I now saw quite clearly that it is discrediting God’s Holy Name, and His reputation as a God who fulfils His promises, to assert that the Jews form the whole Seed of Israel."
