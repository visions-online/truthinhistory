A Listing of the names and titles of The Almighty in the Holy Scriptures.

Throughout history as recorded in the Holy Scriptures, the Lord has revealed Himself to man by many different names and titles.  His purpose in revealing Himself by various names is that man may have a greater and more complete understanding of God's ineffable character and the divine attributes of His sovereign nature.  In finite man's feeble attempt to define the Almighty, the most inclusive definition is that:

>God is Spirit, Infinite and Perfect, the Source, Support and End of all things!


By the self-revelation of the many descriptive names and titles of Himself, God has thus enabled man to understand His divine attribute of; 1) Absolute Spirituality in Life and Personality; 2) Absolute Infinity in Self-existence, Immutability and Unity; 3) Absolute Perfection in Truth, Love and Holiness; also His Relative attributes; 1) relating to Time and Space in Eternity and Immensity; 2) relating to Creation in His Omnipresence, Omniscience and Omnipotence; and 3) relating to Moral Beings in His Faithfulness, Goodness and Justice.
