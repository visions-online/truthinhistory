In times like these, God give us men of vision!

>"Where there is no vision, the people perish."
Proverbs 29:18


>"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: Therefore, hear the Word at my mouth, and give them warning from me."
Ezekiel 3:17


>"And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;"
I Chronicles 12:32


In each age God has sent forerunners to announce the coming of each succeeding dispensation.

In tracing the steps that God has taken in leading His Israel people, three principles are evident.
God has revealed His program in progressive manner.
God has always used a select few to announce the coming of the next order.
God has always announced His program in advance.
As God dealt with His chosen nation of Israel, truth was revealed progressively. Isaiah the prophet declared that truth is received "precept upon precept and line upon line." Isaiah also stated that we learn "here a little and there a little" (Isaiah 28:9-10).

From the time of Adam, it has been God’s will that His Law be established in the earth. Though rejected by His people and fought by Satan, God is still determined to establish His law and set up His kingdom on earth. He will soon bring this to pass!

The knowledge of that coming Kingdom has been received little by little by God’s prophets down through the ages. Peter declared that the benefits of Christ’s death and resurrection "and the glory (or deliverance) that will follow" were not fully understood by the former prophets. He said, "The prophets have inquired and searched diligently" (I Peter 1:10-11). However, truth and knowledge have increased and today we have received greater vision than any preceding generation. The prophets of today have received the revelation of God’s Kingdom. They are now announcing its coming.

God revealed the coming flood to only two people, Enoch and Noah. This was revealed through Methuselah, Enoch’s son, whose name means, "the flood shall come when he dies." God warned His people through the meaning of this name. God repeated this warning through Noah who obeyed and was delivered. Noah was the prophet, or forerunner, for his day.

Moses was the only man at the burning bush to receive God’s instructions to deliver Israel. Moses delivered the Israelites and led them to the Promised Land. "He (God) made known His ways unto Moses, His acts unto the children of Israel" (Psalms 103:7). Moses understood the program, or ways of God, but the people understood only the daily events. Moses was the prophet for his day.

The world is looking for scientists,
The church is looking for theologians,
But God is looking for Prophets.

Though Noah and Moses knew the ultimate plan of God, the people resisted God’s plan to their own destruction. The people in Noah’s day drowned in the flood. The followers of Moses died in the wilderness.

Though the Israelites experienced the miracles of God, they cried to return to Egypt. Millions of Israelites saw the outward acts of God, but only Moses comprehended the plan of God.

Prophets today call for the destruction of the present anti-Christ controlled Babylonian system while the people yearn for the ‘good ole days’. The prophets cry for the Law of God to become the law of the land; while the people hope the present situation will improve. True prophets pray for the Kingdom of God to come to earth, while the people blindly elect a new leader. God has selected only a few to announce His soon coming Kingdom.

The prophet Amos declared, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). God always announces His program in advance. Again, Noah and Moses serve to illustrate this point. God told them what He was going to do. Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel received revelations not only for their day but also for the days yet future. Isaiah prophesied the birth of Christ. Jeremiah prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem. Ezekiel foretold the awakening of Christian Israel in her ‘valley of dry bones’. God does not keep His plans secret, but reveals them to ‘His servants the prophets’.

While the ignorant bemoan the collapse of this evil world system, the prophets rejoice over the terminal cure by which God will purge His kingdom nation. God named these men of vision centuries ago and called them His ‘servants the prophets'. They see beyond today’s turmoil. They see God’s eternal Kingdom on earth. To these men of vision, God reveals not only His outward visible acts, but also His ultimate plan.

Blessed are these ‘servants the prophets’ who proclaim the destruction of Babylon and the establishment of God’s Kingdom.

Blessed are these men who proclaim that the present Satanic system will be replaced by a righteous government where Jesus Christ will rule supreme (Revelation 11:15).

The trumpets of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel are being blown again by God’s modern day prophets. As these men stood alone in their day, so prophets today stand alone in understanding the plan of God. Many ministers, scientists and politicians see the ‘acts’ but fail to understand the plan of God. They bewail the ills of our nation yet fail to see and understand God's ultimate plan for His people. God will soon liberate this earth from the stranglehold of Christian Israel's ancient enemies (Exodus 17:14-16; Numbers 24:20). Satan's chaos will then be replaced by the ultimate plan of all the ages, which is God's Kingdom on earth.

Just as sure as "The Lord spake by his servants the prophets" (II Kings 21:10) in ancient Israel, even today He is proclaiming His Word of warning to our nation. In keeping with His justice, "The mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets" (Revelation 10:7).

## WHEN PEACE BECOMES SIN

>"When principles that run against your deepest convictions begin to win the day, then battles is your calling, peace has become sin; you must, at the price of dearest peace, lay your convictions bare before friend and enemy, with all the fire of your faith."

Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920)
Dutch pastor, theologian & statesman

>"Truth is so obscure in these times and falsehood so established, that unless we love truth, we cannot know it."

Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)

## WANTED

"God, give us Men! A time like this demands
Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;
Men whom the lust of office does not kill;
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;
Men who possess opinions and a will;
Men who have honor;
Men who will not lie;
Men who can stand before a demagogue
And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking!
Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog
In public duty and in private thinking;
For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,
Their large professions and their little deeds,
Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps,
Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps."

Josiah Gilbert Holland (1819-1881)
